# Student Score Prediction System

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**:  
  The system uses machine learning algorithms such as:
  - Regression models: `Linear Regression`, `Decision Trees`, or `Random Forest`.
  - Neural Networks: If deep learning is preferred for more complex predictions.

- **Training Data**:  
  The model is trained using historical student data, which includes:
  - Past academic scores.
  - Attendance records.
  - Behavior metrics.
  - Any other relevant factors that may influence student performance.

- **Evaluation**:  
  To ensure accuracy and reliability, the model is evaluated using the following metrics:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions, without considering their direction.
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Assesses the standard deviation of prediction errors, giving a higher penalty to larger errors.
  - **RÂ² Score**: Indicates how well the model explains the variability of the outcome (student scores).
