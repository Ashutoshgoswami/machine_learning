**Machine Learning Model**
Algorithm: The system uses regression (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest) or neural networks (if deep learning is preferred) to predict the scores.
Training Data: The model is trained using historical student data, including past scores, attendance, behavior metrics, and other relevant factors.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R^2 Score to ensure accuracy.
